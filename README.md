 <!-- About section -->

---
✨ I'm a Data Scientist with a love for making processes more efficient, informative, and scalable through the power of data and machine learning! 

I have a passion for gaming and esports, with the goal of making the games fun and exciting while advocating for inclusive gaming communities.

I've also discovered my love for travel after a month long trip to Asia. I met some of my best friends playing games and travel has connected us outside the screen. So just like I hope to connect people through the internet, I would love to connect them beyond the screen by making travel planning easier, more collaborative, and cheap!

- ⚙️ I use daily: `python`, `sql`, `pandas`, `pytorch`, `scikit-Learn`, `vscode`

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a champion recommender system for League of Legends draft!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get to use LLMs to empower a travel planning side-project.
